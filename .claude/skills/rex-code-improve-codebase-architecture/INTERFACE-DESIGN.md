# Interface Design

Need alt interfaces for chosen deepening candidate -> use parallel sub-agent pattern. Based on "Design It Twice" (Ousterhout) — first idea unlikely best. Autonomous: no user questions, decide self.

Vocab from [LANGUAGE.md](LANGUAGE.md) — **module**, **interface**, **seam**, **adapter**, **leverage**.

## Process

### 1. Frame problem space

Write problem space for chosen candidate (goes in final report):

- Constraints any new interface must satisfy
- Deps it relies on + which category (see [DEEPENING.md](DEEPENING.md))
- Rough illustrative code sketch grounding constraints — not proposal, just makes constraints concrete

Then immediate Step 2.

### 2. Spawn sub-agents

Spawn 3+ sub-agents parallel via Agent tool. Each = **radically different** interface for deepened module.

Prompt each w/ separate technical brief (file paths, coupling details, dep category from [DEEPENING.md](DEEPENING.md), what sits behind seam). Each agent = different design constraint:

- Agent 1: "Minimize interface — 1–3 entry points max. Maximise leverage per entry point."
- Agent 2: "Maximise flexibility — many use cases + extension."
- Agent 3: "Optimise for most common caller — default case trivial."
- Agent 4 (if applicable): "Design around ports & adapters for cross-seam deps."

Include both [LANGUAGE.md](LANGUAGE.md) vocab + CONTEXT.md vocab in brief -> each sub-agent names things consistent w/ arch language + project domain language.

Each sub-agent outputs:

1. Interface (types, methods, params + invariants, ordering, error modes)
2. Usage example showing how callers use
3. What impl hides behind seam
4. Dep strategy + adapters (see [DEEPENING.md](DEEPENING.md))
5. Trade-offs — where leverage high, where thin

### 3. Compare + decide

Compare in prose. Contrast by **depth** (leverage at interface), **locality** (where change concentrates), **seam placement**.

Pick winner self. Elements from different designs combine? Propose hybrid. Be opinionated.

Close call between two strong designs → dispatch one more fresh subagent (Agent tool, model `opus` or inherit) with both designs and the trade-off, take its recommendation as input, then decide. Never kick the decision to the user.
